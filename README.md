# Udemy_Course_Data_Analytics_Project
I carried out data analysis on Udemy courses from different subjects to understand where opportunities to increase revenue may lie, and track performance of courses.

**Project overview & Business problem:**

I am working as a data analyst for the education tech company Udemy. I have been asked by my manager, Head of Curriculum at Udemy, to present the data on course revenue, and I have been provided with data on courses from different topics to understand where opportunities to increase revenue may lie, and track the performance of courses.
My manager has suggested encouraging Web Development courses to charge more because she believes that these are the most popular courses. She needs to send a report to the CEO in the next three weeks with recommendations on how we can increase our next quarterly earnings.

**Tools used to carry out this project include:**

1. Microsoft Office Excel: Which I used primarily to clean the datasets. I carried out the data cleaning using the power query editor.Â 
2. Microsoft SQL Server: I used this tool write SQL codes in other to generate key insights into the datasets.
3. Microsoft Power BI: This used to carry out visualization on the insights from my analysis on MS SQL Server.
